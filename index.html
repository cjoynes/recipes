<h1>Black Beans</h1>
From Adam Ragusea: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhTVwNMeFI&list=FLCi3ZURq-6ir-yfUKG40c9w&index=36">Link.</a>
I made this without using the vinegar, we'll see how it turns out lmao
<ul>
	<li>1 lb dried black beans</li>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>1 bell pepper</li>
	<li>2 jalapeño peppers</li>
	<li>2-3 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
	<li>2-3 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
	<li>salt</li>
	<li>pepper</li>
	<li>olive oil</li>
	<li>water</li>
	<li>lime wedges for garnish</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>The night before you want to eat, put the beans in a large bowl
		and cover them with at least a few inches of water to soak. 
	<li>The next day, start the beans by chopping up the onion and peppers
		and cooking them in olive oil in a big pot until they start to soften.
		Drain the beans and discard the soaking water.
		 Add them to the pot along with enough fresh water to cover by an inch.
		  Put in the oregano, cumin, pepper, garlic powder, vinegar and sugar.
		   Don't put in the salt yet. Simmer the pot for two hours, or until the
			beans are soft, stirring occasionally. Put in additional water if the
			 beans ever stop being submerged.
	<li>When the beans are soft, add salt to taste, and maybe some more vinegar or sugar. Turn off the heat and let them cool at least 15 minutes to allow the liquid to thicken.	
	<li>Put some rice on a plate, some beans on the rice, some onions and additional cilantro on the side with a lime wedge.
</ol>

<h1>Basic Bread</h1>
From March/April 2020, just like everyone else's bread recipe
<ul>
<li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
<li>2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups bread flour</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until bubbles form on surface. Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 3 cups flour. </li>
	<li>Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.</li>
		<li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. Shape each into a loaf. </li>
				<li>Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
	
					<li>Bake at 375° until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200°, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.</li>
</ol>
