<a name='Dimani'></a>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Dimani</button>
<div class="content">
	Spinach pasta with cream sauce. Typically make with chicken on the side.
	<ul>
        <li>1 box pasta (Gemelli if you can find it) </li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter (yes this is a lot)</li>
        <li>Spinach. 1 bag / 1/2 box (the more the merrier)</li>
        <li>~4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sage</li>
        <li>4-8 oz whipping cream / light cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese (can use parmesan as well)</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Get pasta water boiling, cook pasta while making sauce. You'll figure out the timing once you make it.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, melt butter in pan on medium low. Once melted, add spinach and saute until wilted.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and saute until fragrant. Add sage, cream, cheese. Stir to prevent burning or skin formation. Add more cheese to taste.</li>
        <li>Once pasta and sauce are complete, combine in the pasta pot. This doesn't need thickening with pasta water, the cheese thickens the sauce. If it doesn't, add more cheese. You cannot have enough cheese in this recpie, I cannot stress this enough.</li>

	<li>Pull the other half over the filling, sealing the edge and pressing a fork in if you want to be fancy.</li>
