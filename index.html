<li>6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups bread flour</li>

				<li>Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
	
					<li>Bake at 375째 until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200째, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.</li>

<a name='Pierogi'></a>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pierogi</button>
<div class="content">
From <a href="https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/how-to-make-pierogi">here</a>.
<h3>Dough:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>3 cups flour (Maybe a bit less, 2.5 cups)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup milk (or water)</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1+1/8 tsp salt</li>
	<li>10 g oil (look at the label for volume)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Beat milk, eggs together. Add flour, salt, oil. Mix until shaggy dough forms.</li>
	<li>Let rest 10 minutes.</li>
	<li>Knead until smooth and passes window test. Keep refrigerated until forming dumplings.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Filling:</h3> This ended up making a little more filling than necessary.
<ul>
	<li>2 lbs potatoes</li>
	<li>Salt for boiling water</li>
	<li>Cheddar cheese, 100g ish but probably more</li>
	<li>1 tbsp butter</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Peel and cube potatoes. Add to pot with salted water, bring to light boil.</li>
	<li>Stir pot, boil until potatoes are mashable with a fork.</li>
	<li>Drain potatoes, add butter and mash with a fork. Add cheese and keep mashing until smooth.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Forming:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Roll dough out very thin. Thinner than you think.</li>
	<li>Use circular object to cut out circles the size you want your pierogi.</li>
	<li>Add filling to each, trying to keep on one half of the circle and leaving a rim.</li>
	<li>Pull the other half over the filling, sealing the edge and pressing a fork in if you want to be fancy.</li>
	<li>Boil salted water. Drop pierogi in, and remove once they float.</li>
	<li>Once most of the water has come off, add to pan with butter / olive oil and pan fry.</li>
	<li>Saute some yellow onions until soft, they go really well with the pierogi.</li>	
</ol>
